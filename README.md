### Hall Management System Overview

1. **Student Admission**: After a student takes admission, their name, permanent address, contact telephone number, and photograph are recorded. The student is then allotted a hall and a specific room number. A letter indicating the allotted room is issued to the student.
2. **Mess Charges**: Students incur monthly mess charges. The mess manager inputs the total charges for each student in a month on the mess account.
3. **Room Rent and Amenities**: Each room has a fixed room rent. The halls provide certain amenities to the students, such as reading rooms, playrooms, TV rooms, etc. A fixed amount is levied on each student for amenities.
4. **Complaints and Requests**: Students can raise various types of complaints and repair requests using a web browser. These include requests for fused lights, non-functional water taps, non-functional water filters, room repair, etc.
5. **Grant Distribution**: The HMC chairman can distribute the annual grant among the different halls. Wardens of different halls can enter their expenditure details against the allocations.
6. **Staff Management**: The halls employ attendants and gardeners. The Hall clerk can enter leave details for attendants or gardeners. At the end of every month, a consolidated list of salary payable to each employee is printed out.
